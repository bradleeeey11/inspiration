recently i’ve been beating myself up a lot. 
i’ve been feeling so discouraged, like i can’t do anything. 
i feel like my peers are so ahead of me and i’m too far behind to catch up. 
all my peers are so talented and seeing that, instead of being inspired and wanting to do more i don’t want to do anything at all. 
i want to sleep and i waste my days. 
i wish i could get over this creative block. 
i haven’t made anything i’ve been proud of in so long. 
i need to be more confident. 
starting school again has made me feel a bit better. 
i’m more hopeful. 
i hope i can make things i am proud of in the future.
