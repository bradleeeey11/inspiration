hey bradley it’s officially a month til you go to school. 
(future bradley: you’re wrong you thought it was the 22nd) 
you’re at nana’s house and walking around the golf course. 
your reason for writing this is because you’re listening to “look at me now” by caroline polachek. 
you got off the phone with josh a couple minutes ago. 
hahaha i bet that one didn’t end well. 
or maybe you have a good relationship? 
let’s hope he didn’t use you because he’s super cute but let’s be honest that’s just me being hopeful because you know how i am.
WOW though!! school is in a month!! 
let’s hope new york isn’t a total bitch but it probably is. 
i hope you’re making it work but if it’s stressful right now don’t be too hard on yourself because it’s crazy you’ve even made it to that point. 
bradley starting out on flickr sure couldn’t have imagined this!! 
i hope you’ve made some cool friends and everyone is being nice to you!! 
if they aren’t then that’s their loss because we both know you’re such an amazing friend and so sweet. 
right now things are weird. 
every day is feeling the same and you’re honestly sad but you don’t want to admit it.
i hope you’ve found some happiness in yourself instead of others or materialistic things. 
i’m listening to PANG! rn and as i’m walking i think i’m realizing i’m lost. 
maybe that’s my own fault because i got a little over confident i WOULDNT get lost. 
ok i just remembered i marked my location on maps so time for me to find my way back!! 
see look at that being over prepared works!! you can always figure out a solution. 
ok sorry for my positive bullshit i know you’re cringing because i did writing it. 
ok bye i love you hope everything is going well you can do anything!!

update: you walked by it lmao and ocean of tears is playing (SO GOOD!!)
